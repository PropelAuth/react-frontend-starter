## React PropelAuth Starter

This repo contains a forkable repo which uses [PropelAuth](https://www.propelauth.com/?utm_campaign=github) where users can sign up, login, manage their accounts, and view organization and member information.

[Here](https://docs.propelauth.com/example-apps/apps) are guides which will walk you through how to use this frontend code with a variety of backend library options.

### Getting Started

Make sure to update .env with your project's information. Then, install and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
